    dialogText: Sir, the Machines left a lot of fuel canister in that choke point.
      Rangers like me always carry deployable mines to ambush our foes. A single mine
      near those canister will cause a massive chain reaction as soon as a drone get
      close.
    tutorialText: All units have a special ability they can use. Target a location
      with your cursor, hold [A], [B], [X] or [Y] for a moment and release the button
      to order the ability. Rangers will deploy mines when ordered.

    dialogText: Yes, and once a mine set, someone can bait all these drones into the
      trap. It might be best if you all stay nehind and I go ahead.
    tutorialText: The Rangers' mines detonates for heavy damages when enemies aproach
      it. Be careful, it will also hurt your own troops if they are too close.

    dialogText: It's your call commander. But we can also do it if necessary.
    tutorialText: Pressing [A], [B], [X] or [Y] twice while aiming with your cursor
      will force the corresponding unit to move while ignoring enemies along the way.
